                        The first time I saw you, I fell in love with you deeply. Slowly, I
                        found that I would be happy with you when you are happy, and I would
                        be sad with you when you are sad.
                        Later, we finally got together and had a perfect and happy time. I
                        always feel that meeting you is my luck. I am grateful for all the
                        beautiful memories weâ€™ve shared. I regard these as my most precious
                        gifts.
                        I hope that we will continue to stay in touch in the future and create
                        a better life together.
